0, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA=0A=0AEveryone is permitted to copy and dis=
tribute verbatim copies=0Aof this license document, but changing it is no=
t allowed.=0A=0APreamble=0A=0AThe licenses for most software are designed=
 to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU G=
eneral Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and =
change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users=
=2E This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foun=
dation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using =
it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU L=
ibrary General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs=
, too.=0A=0AWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, =
not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you=
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for t=
his service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if y=
ou want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new f=
ree programs; and that you know you can do these things.=0A=0ATo protect =
your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you =
these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions tr=
anslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of t=
he software, or if you modify it.=0A=0AFor example, if you distribute cop=
ies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the rec=
ipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, =
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so=
 they know their rights.=0A=0AWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) =
copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you le=
gal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.=0A=0AAlso,=
 for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that ever=
yone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the=
 software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipien=
ts to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems =
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputation=
s.=0A=0AFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software pa=
tents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program =
will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program pr=
oprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be=
 licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.=0A=0AThe precis=
e terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.=
=0A=0ATERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION=0A=0A=
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a not=
ice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the=
 terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to an=
y such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either th=
e Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a w=
ork containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with mo=
difications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, transl=
ation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each li=
censee is addressed as "you".=0A=0AActivities other than copying, distrib=
ution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside =
its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the outp=
ut from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work bas=
ed on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program=
). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.=0A=0A1. You may=
 copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you =
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriat=
ely publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer o=
f warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to=
 the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Progra=
m a copy of this License along with the Program.=0A=0AYou may charge a fe=
e for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option=
 offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.=0A=0A2. You may modify =
your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a w=
ork based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or w=
ork under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all o=
f these conditions:=0A=0A    * a) You must cause the modified files to ca=
rry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of =
any change.=0A=0A    * b) You must cause any work that you distribute or =
publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program=
 or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third=
 parties under the terms of this License.=0A=0A    * c) If the modified p=
rogram normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it,=
 when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, =
to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright no=
tice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you pro=
vide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these =
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exc=
eption: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print =
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to p=
rint an announcement.)=20=0A=0AThese requirements apply to the modified w=
ork as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived fro=
m the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate =
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to th=
ose sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you dis=
tribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the=
 Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this Lice=
nse, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, an=
d thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.=0A=0AThus, it i=
s not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights t=
o work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the rig=
ht to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on=
 the Program.=0A=0AIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not base=
d on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) o=
n a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other w=
ork under the scope of this License.=0A=0A3. You may copy and distribute =
the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or ex=
ecutable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you=
 also do one of the following:=0A=0A    * a) Accompany it with the comple=
te corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed =
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used fo=
r software interchange; or,=0A=0A    * b) Accompany it with a written off=
er, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge=
 no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a c=
omplete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be dis=
tributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customaril=
y used for software interchange; or,=0A=0A    * c) Accompany it with the =
information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding sour=
ce code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution=
 and only if you received the program in object code or executable form w=
ith such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)=20=0A=0AThe source=
 code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifica=
tions to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the s=
ource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface def=
inition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installat=
ion of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code d=
istributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in eit=
her source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, a=
nd so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless th=
at component itself accompanies the executable.=0A=0AIf distribution of e=
xecutable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a design=
ated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from =
the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though thi=
rd parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object cod=
e.=0A=0A4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Progra=
m except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise =
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will a=
utomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties w=
ho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not =
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full com=
pliance.=0A=0A5. You are not required to accept this License, since you h=
ave not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify =
or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are proh=
ibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying =
or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indic=
ate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and condi=
tions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based o=
n it.=0A=0A6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based o=
n the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the o=
riginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to the=
se terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on t=
he recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not respons=
ible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.=0A=0A7. I=
f, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringem=
ent or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions ar=
e imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that co=
ntradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the =
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy sim=
ultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent o=
bligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at a=
ll. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redist=
ribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indir=
ectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this L=
icense would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.=0A=0A=
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any=
 particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply=
 and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.=0A=
=0AIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any pa=
tents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such c=
laims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of t=
he free software distribution system, which is implemented by public lice=
nse practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide r=
ange of software distributed through that system in reliance on consisten=
t application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if h=
e or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a=
 licensee cannot impose that choice.=0A=0AThis section is intended to mak=
e thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of th=
is License.=0A=0A8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is rest=
ricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interface=
s, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this Licens=
e may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding thos=
e countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries=
 not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitatio=
n as if written in the body of this License.=0A=0A9. The Free Software Fo=
undation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public Li=
cense from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to t=
he present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or c=
oncerns.=0A=0AEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If t=
he Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it=
 and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and =
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by th=
e Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version num=
ber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Fre=
e Software Foundation.=0A=0A10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the P=
rogram into other free programs whose distribution conditions are differe=
nt, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copy=
righted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Found=
ation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided=
 by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our=
 free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software general=
ly.=0A=0ANO WARRANTY=0A=0A11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHA=
RGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APP=
LICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER=
S AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF AN=
Y KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE I=
MPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE=
=2E THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS W=
ITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL N=
ECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.=0A=0A12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQ=
UIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER=
, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PE=
RMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECI=
AL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILI=
TY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA =
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR =
A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUC=
H HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAG=
ES.=0A=0AEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS=0A=0AHow to Apply These Terms to You=
r New Programs=0A=0AIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be o=
f the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this i=
s to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change und=
er these terms.=0A=0ATo do so, attach the following notices to the progra=
